# README - Lab 4 - COSC 52 - Katherine Taylor

I created a website where you can log complaints and let off some quarantine steam. There is a full view, an individual post view, and the ability to add, delete, and edit posts. It also supports markdown.

I liked this lab a lot! React-Redux makes way more sense to me than the React we used on Lab 3. I think in the end I got pretty much everything to work! At first it was a bit hard to figure out how to render and map posts and post, but after working on it for a bit and going to office hours I figured it out!

## Notes
The tag before adding in Lab 5 p.2 is tagged "v2" instead of v1 because for some reason the tag v1 already existed
